Summer is over, back to work! We’ve released Modernizr 2.6.2 with a number of new detects, bug fixes, and test improvements for your modern development needs.

Some notable fixes include:

* Fix for a [hilarious edge case](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/issues/524) in Safari where if you set your body or html element to `overflow-y: scroll` and apply styles to the webkit-scrollbars ([see demo](http://jsbin.com/ecetor/4/edit#html)), the browser spontaneously refreshes
* HTML5 Shiv got a fix for better compatibility with jPlayer
* Generated Content false-positive fix for IE7
* Fix for our download builder and turning off css classes
* Better Travis CI output for unit tests using grunt
* All incoming pull requests are tested against our test suite with Travis CI

#### Detects

We’ve also added some new detects:

* Content Security Policy
* CSS's `object-fit`
* `position: sticky;`
* `@supports` : CSS's new native feature detection
* viewport unit tests: vhunit, vmaxunit, vminunit, vwunit
* `input[form]` attribute
* new iframe attributes: sandbox, seamless, srcdoc
* PointerLock API

#### Test improvements

And lastly, there have been updates to these tests:

* `background-size: cover`
* css filters
* css subpixelfont
* elem-track - reflecting partial support by IE10
* gamepad api

For more details on the exact code changes of this release, see [the full changelog on GitHub](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/compare/v2.6.1...v2.6.2).

We thank our great dev community who have contributed much of the work for this update. Thanks to their moms and dads, too.
